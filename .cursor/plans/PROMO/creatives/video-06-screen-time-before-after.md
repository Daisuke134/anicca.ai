## Kling プロンプト（ベストプラクティス適用版）

### シーン1: スクリーンタイム Before（0-5秒）

```
SUBJECT: Female hand holding an iPhone displaying Screen Time report showing "5h 12m" daily average.

ACTION: The hand holds the phone steady. The screen content is static and clearly readable. After 2 seconds, the thumb gently taps the screen once, as if dismissing or acknowledging the notification. A subtle sigh is implied through a slight hand tension.

CONTEXT: Clean, neutral background. Soft morning light. Focus entirely on the phone screen and the damning number—5 hours of screen time staring back.

STYLE: Cinematic, clean, Apple-style product photography feel. The number "5h 12m" is the star of this shot.

CAMERA: Static locked shot. No camera movement. The stillness forces the viewer to confront the number—just as the person holding the phone must confront it.

LENS: 50mm equivalent, f/2.8.

MOTION SPECIFICS: Minimal—hand holds steady (95% static), single thumb tap at 2-3s mark. The phone itself does not move. The lack of motion emphasizes the weight of the moment.
```

### シーン2: Before - 深夜のスマホ（5-10秒）

```
SUBJECT: A young Asian woman lying in bed at night, her face illuminated only by harsh blue smartphone light. Dark circles under her eyes.

ACTION: She scrolls her phone with glazed, tired eyes. Her thumb moves slowly, mechanically. She blinks heavily. Her expression shows subtle guilt—she knows she should stop but can't. She sighs, her shoulders dropping slightly.

CONTEXT: Dark bedroom, late night. The only light is the harsh blue glow from her phone. This is unhealthy, familiar, relatable.

STYLE: Cinematic, documentary realism, unflattering lighting. This should feel uncomfortably real—like catching yourself in this moment.

CAMERA: Static medium close-up at eye level. No camera movement. The stillness mirrors her stuck state—unable to move, unable to stop scrolling.

LENS: 50mm equivalent, f/2.0.

MOTION SPECIFICS: Thumb scrolls slowly and continuously. Eyes blink heavily at 2s and 4s marks. Shoulders drop with sigh at 3s mark. Face remains otherwise still—the lack of energy emphasizes exhaustion.
```
**入力画像:** Nano Bananaで生成したシーン2画像
**Duration:** 5秒

---

### シーン3: Aniicha通知（10-15秒）

```
SUBJECT: The same young Asian woman, now sitting up slightly in bed, looking at her phone displaying the Anicca app Talk interface.

ACTION: Her expression transforms in a clear arc: tired (0-1s) → curious as she reads (1-2s) → softening, guard dropping (2-3.5s) → gentle, genuine smile (3.5-5s). She pulls the phone slightly closer as her interest grows. The harsh blue light has been replaced by a warmer glow.

CONTEXT: Same bedroom, but the atmosphere is shifting. The phone's glow now feels caring rather than harsh. This is the moment of intervention—the turning point.

STYLE: Cinematic, hopeful transition. The lighting shift (cold to warm) mirrors the emotional shift.

CAMERA: Static medium close-up, slightly from above. No camera movement. The stillness allows the viewer to focus entirely on her subtle expression changes.

LENS: 50mm equivalent, f/2.0.

MOTION SPECIFICS: Expression arc is the primary motion—smooth transition through emotions. Phone moves 5cm closer to face during curious phase. Eyes move as if reading a message on screen. Light on her face subtly warms over the duration.
```
**入力画像:** Nano Bananaで生成したシーン3画像
**Duration:** 5秒

---

### シーン4: After - 穏やかな夜（15-20秒）

```
SUBJECT: The same young Asian woman reading a physical book in bed, warm golden lamp light illuminating her face. Phone visible face-down on nightstand, ignored.

ACTION: She turns a page of her book with a relaxed, content expression. She takes a slow, deep breath—a genuine relaxation breath, not a tired sigh. Her eyes move as she reads. She reaches for a cup of tea on the nightstand and takes a small sip. A peaceful half-smile appears.

CONTEXT: Same bedroom, completely transformed. Warm, cozy, hygge atmosphere. The phone is present but ignored—a powerful visual statement. This is what healthy evening time looks like.

STYLE: Cinematic, aspirational, hygge/cozy. Warm golden tones throughout. This is the "After" that viewers aspire to.

CAMERA: Static medium shot. No camera movement. The stillness mirrors her peaceful state—she's no longer frantically scrolling. She's present.

LENS: 50mm equivalent, f/2.0 for soft background.

MOTION SPECIFICS: Page turn (1s), deep breath with rising/falling shoulders (1-2s), hand reaches for tea (2-3s), sips tea (3-4s), returns to reading with smile (4-5s). All movements are slow, intentional, relaxed.
```
**入力画像:** Nano Bananaで生成したシーン4画像
**Duration:** 5秒

---

### シーン5: スクリーンタイム After（20-25秒）

```
SUBJECT: Same iPhone held by same female hand, now displaying Screen Time report showing "2h 08m" daily average.

ACTION: The hand holds the phone steady, presenting the result with quiet pride. After 2 seconds, a subtle victorious gesture—a small, satisfied squeeze of the phone or slight lift. The visual callback to Scene 1 creates powerful before/after juxtaposition.

CONTEXT: Same clean background as Scene 1. Same lighting. Same framing. But the number has transformed. The visual symmetry emphasizes the change.

STYLE: Cinematic, triumphant, clean. This is proof—undeniable evidence of transformation.

CAMERA: Static locked shot, identical to Scene 1. No camera movement. The identical framing forces the viewer to focus on the only thing that changed—the number.

LENS: 50mm equivalent, f/2.8.

MOTION SPECIFICS: Mostly static (95%). Subtle satisfied hand gesture at 3s mark—small squeeze or lift of phone. The minimal movement emphasizes that this is a "reveal" moment.

### Arcads.aiスクリプト（英語版）

```
[HOOK - 0-5秒]
5 hours.
That's what my screen time used to say. Every. Single. Day.
Like... I'd check it and just... feel sick.

[PROBLEM - 5-15秒]
And it wasn't like I was doing anything important. Just... scrolling. 
11pm. Midnight. 1am. And then I'd feel terrible the next day.
But I couldn't stop. I tried app blockers, I tried leaving my phone in another room—nothing worked.

[SOLUTION - 15-28秒]
Then I found Aniicha. And honestly... it's different.
It's not about blocking or forcing you. It's this gentle voice that just says... "Hey, it's getting late. Let's wind down."
And for some reason, when it's a voice—not a notification—I actually listen.
It feels like someone actually cares.

[RESULT - 28-35秒]
One month later. 2 hours.
That's my screen time now. I read before bed. I actually sleep.
I got my evenings back.

[CTA - 35-40秒]
If you're tired of watching your screen time go up every week... try Aniicha. Link in bio.
```

**句読点ノート:**
- `...` = 呼吸/ため息の間（0.5秒）
- 短い文 = パンチ力。「5 hours. That's what my screen time used to say.」
- 数字の繰り返し = 記憶に残る。「5 hours」「2 hours」

### Arcads.aiスクリプト（日本語版）

```
[HOOK - 0-5秒]
5時間。
毎日のスクリーンタイム。毎回見るたびに...ゾッとしてた。

[PROBLEM - 5-15秒]
別に大事なことしてたわけじゃない。ただ...スクロールしてただけ。
23時、0時、1時...そして次の日、最悪の気分。
アプリブロッカーも試した。スマホを別の部屋に置くのも試した。何も効かなかった。

[SOLUTION - 15-28秒]
そんな時...Aniccaを見つけた。
正直...全然違った。
ブロックとか、強制じゃない。優しい声が「そろそろ休もう」って言ってくれるだけ。
通知じゃなくて、声だから...なぜか聞ける。
本当に自分のこと気にかけてくれてる感じがする。

[RESULT - 28-35秒]
1ヶ月後。2時間。
今のスクリーンタイム。寝る前に本を読むようになった。ちゃんと眠れるようになった。
夜の時間、取り戻した。

[CTA - 35-40秒]
毎週スクリーンタイムが増えてくのを見てるなら...Anicca試してみて。リンクはプロフに。
