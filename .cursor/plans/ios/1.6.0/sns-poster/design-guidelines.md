# SNS Image Design Guidelines

## Core Principles

**Apple-inspired minimalism. Less is more.**

## Style Requirements

### Colors
- **Primary**: Black and white / monotone
- **Accent**: Single subtle accent color if needed (e.g., subtle gray, muted blue)
- **Background**: Pure black (#000) or pure white (#FFF)
- **Text**: High contrast - white on black, black on white

### Typography
- Clean, sans-serif fonts (SF Pro, Helvetica Neue, Inter)
- Large, bold headlines
- Generous whitespace
- Minimal text - let the design breathe

### Layout
- Centered, balanced composition
- Grid-based alignment
- Plenty of negative space
- NO clutter

### What to AVOID
- ❌ Gradients (unless very subtle)
- ❌ Neon colors / bright accents
- ❌ Human faces or figures
- ❌ Busy backgrounds
- ❌ Too many elements
- ❌ Emojis in images
- ❌ Drop shadows
- ❌ 3D effects
- ❌ Stock photo vibes

### What to DO
- ✅ Simple geometric shapes
- ✅ Clean iconography (line icons)
- ✅ Minimal abstract elements
- ✅ Typography as the hero
- ✅ Black/white with ONE accent color max
- ✅ Think: Apple keynote slides
