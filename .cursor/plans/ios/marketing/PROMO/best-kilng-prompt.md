Kling has emerged as a powerful video generation model that provides professional-grade results at a cost that is significantly cheaper than many other leading models, making high-end video generation more accessible.

Based on our research, we’re sharing the best prompting advice for Kling, with a focus on Kling’s greatest strength: camera motion and character physics. We’ll explain to you how to prompt with narrative intent, helping you connect every camera movement to a specific narrative goal rather than using it as a standalone effect.

We love sharing our research results on how to best prompt for video generation, so check our guides for other models:

Prompting Essentials for Kling AI
A strong Kling prompt relies on four key elements. If you omit any of these, the model is forced to guess, which can lead to vague output that doesn’t match your vision. For precise, predictable results, always specify these four elements:

Subject: The primary focus of the video, such as a character, creature, or object.
Action: What the subject does.
Context: Where the action takes place. This includes the setting, surroundings, environment, time of day, etc.
Style: The overall visual aesthetic. You can define this with a film genre (like “film noir”), a visual tone (“gritty realism”), or a specific format (“TV commercial”).
These four elements are the essential foundation. To gain even more directorial control, you can add optional modifiers like camera movement, camera angle, camera framing, lighting, etc.

Let’s see an example of a good Kling ai video prompt:

Prompt

A static shot of a burger as it assembles in mid-air. The entire shot is in dramatic slow-motion. The individual ingredients—a grilled patty, fresh lettuce, tomato, melting cheese, and a toasted bun—fly into place from different directions. The background is a clean, simple, professional studio gradient to keep the focus on the product. Style: TV food commercial

The prompt adherence is great! We got the result we wanted because we defined a clear subject (a burger), an unambiguous context (a professional studio gradient), a simple action (ingredients “fly into place”), and an appropriate style for this video (a “TV food commercial”).

By specifying a “static shot” for the camera, we ensure the focus remains on the complex motion of the ingredients, without distracting the viewer with random camera movement. The secret sauce (pun intended) of this video is the “dramatic slow-motion,” which makes the shot look professional and gives the viewer enough time to see how delicious this burger looks!

How to Prompt for Cinematic Motion in Kling: Tips & Examples
Kling’s greatest strength is its understanding of motion, from complex character physics to realistic camera movements. However, this is also the easiest place to make a mistake.

If camera movement is added just to be interesting, it risks becoming meaningless. Think of a sweeping drone shot that rises to reveal nothing new, or a push-in on a character’s face that isn’t tied to any specific emotion or realization. It’s motion for its own sake.

Your camera’s movement should always be motivated and serve a clear purpose, such as:

To show action: Following a subject’s movement, such as a tracking shot that stays with a character as they run down a hallway.
To reveal information: Showing something previously off-screen, like a slow pan that moves from a character’s face to reveal the person standing behind them.
To show emotion: Emphasizing a character’s internal state, such as a slow push-in (dolly) to create intimacy or show a character’s “moment of realization.”
To show perspective: Simulating a character’s point of view, like a handheld shot that looks around a room as if through the character’s own eyes.
Now that we’ve established the basic principles of motivated motion, let’s put them into practice. Over the following sections, we’ll break down the most popular cinematic camera movements, one by one. For each move, we’ll show you what it is, when to use it for maximum narrative impact, and how to prompt for it in Kling.

Pan & Tilt
What It Is
A pan (short for panorama) is the horizontal rotation of the camera from a fixed position, mimicking a person turning their head to look side-to-side. A tilt is the vertical rotation of the camera from a fixed position, mimicking a person looking up or down.

When to Use It (Narrative Intent)
Panning and tilting are the camera’s fundamental movements for observing and surveying the environment:

Pan: This is the primary tool for a motivated reveal. If a character looks off-screen, a pan can follow their gaze to show what they see. A slow pan is used to build suspense, forcing the audience to wait for the crucial information at the end of the movement. It is also used to establish the massive scale of a landscape.
Tilt: This is often used to communicate vertical scale or power dynamics.
Tilt up (from a low angle): Makes the subject appear powerful, dominant, or heroic.
Tilt down (from a high angle): Makes the subject appear weak, vulnerable, or inferior.
Example Prompt
In this example, we first generated an image using our Lucid Origin model that we then used as the starting frame of the video—the Leonardo.Ai app makes it easy to instantly switch between image and video generations:


Once our first frame was ready, we used this prompt:

Prompt

The camera pans slowly to the right, moving away from the detective’s shocked face, who remains petrified. The pan gradually and deliberately reveals a massive, sprawling, complex clue board on the wall, covered in photos, maps, and red string connecting clues. Cinematic, suspenseful, dramatic reveal.

Observations
This prompt uses a “pan-to-reveal” movement with perfect narrative justification. The character’s reaction (“shocked face, petrified”) sets the emotional tone, and the subsequent slow camera movement is motivated to shift the audience’s focus from the character’s emotion to the information that caused it. By specifying the camera pans slowly and deliberately, we instruct Kling to sustain the suspense, avoiding a fast, meaningless whip-pan.

Exercise for You
Prompt a shot of a knight standing in a field. Start with a low angle and use a slow tilt up that ends on the sky. Analyze how this tilt makes the knight appear more heroic and powerful. You can use Kling or the video models of your choice—on Leonardo.Ai you can easily switch between different models like Veo, Sora, Kling, Hailuo, etc.

Push In & Pull Out (The Dolly)
What It Is
A dolly shot involves moving the entire camera physically through space. A push in (or dolly-in) moves the camera closer to the subject, while a pull out (or dolly-out) moves the camera away from the subject.

The dolly is fundamentally different from a zoom. The zoom changes the lens’s focal length and remains static, creating an unnatural visual effect. Dollying feels more natural to us because, as humans, we must physically approach a subject to see it closer, making the lens zoom look inherently unnatural (which, of course, can be used to create specific stylistic effects).

When to Use It (Narrative Intent)
Dolly shots manipulate proximity, making them powerful tools for controlling the audience’s emotional relationship with the subject.

Push in: This is the primary tool for building intimacy and empathy. It physically brings the audience closer, forcing them to share the character’s personal space. It is the classic technique to signify a character’s “moment of realization” or to emphasize the emotional intensity of a moment.
Pull out: This movement creates distance, both physical and emotional. It is often used to highlight a character’s isolation or loneliness or to suddenly reveal the broader, overwhelming context of the environment, making the character seem small or vulnerable.
Example Prompt
Just as for our previous example, we first generated an image of a determined basketball player at the free-throw line using our Lucid Origin model. Once our first frame was ready, we used this prompt:

Prompt

The camera begins a very slow push-in (dolly-in), moving steadily closer to the player’s face. This movement builds anticipation and emphasizes the emotional intensity of this crucial moment in a tied game. The background blurs away as the camera’s focus sharpens on her determined expression, ending in a tight close-up on her eyes just before she takes the shot. Cinematic, sports ad, tense, dramatic, aspirational.

Observations
The shot we generated could work well inside a sequence where this is the last shot of a tied game and there is immense pressure on the player. With the help of the push-in, we manage to make the viewer feel more of that pressure. The movement starts slowly and accelerates a bit in the second part of the clip, heightening the pressure felt by the player (and the viewer). Overall, matching Kling’s capability with narrative intent gave us a great result—this shot could work well inside a sports ad or even a movie.

Exercise for You
Start with a close-up of a character looking happy in a room. Use a slow pull out that moves the camera backward from the subject’s face, revealing an empty and large room. Analyze how the movement changes the mood from happiness to isolation.

Tracking & Trucking
What It Is
A tracking shot is a broad term for any shot where the camera physically moves through space, most commonly used to follow a subject. A trucking shot is a specific type of tracking shot where the camera moves laterally (side-to-side), parallel to the subject.

When to Use It (Narrative Intent)
Tracking shots transform the viewer from a passive observer into an active participant:

Tracking: This is a powerful tool for building immersion and tension. By moving with the subject, the audience feels like they are walking beside or experiencing the journey firsthand. A long, unbroken tracking shot locks the audience into the scene in real-time, building anticipation of what’s to come. It asks the audience, “Where is this character going and what is going to happen?”
Trucking: This is primarily an “observational” or “processional” move. It allows the audience to move alongside a subject, making them feel like they’re on the road right alongside them, which is perfect for car chases or action sequences.
Example Prompt
For this example, we first generated an image of a high-performance sports car on a salt flat using our Lucid Origin model, and then we used this prompt:

Prompt

The camera trucks (moves laterally) at the same high speed, perfectly parallel to the car and its driver. The car stays locked in the center of the frame. In the second half of the shot, the car executes a quick, slight S-curve maneuver, kicking up a small plume of white salt dust from its tires. The camera perfectly mirrors this S-curve, moving with the car to keep it locked in the center of the frame, before both straighten out again. Cinematic, car commercial, high-energy.

Observations
This electric sports car runs at a very high speed, and through the tracking shot, we’re offering the viewer the ability to experience more closely how driving such a car feels. Kling’s prompt adherence is good, and the result is a high-energy, technically complex shot that feels dynamic and believable.

Exercise for You
Prompt a shot of a character running down a long, narrow alleyway during a foggy night. Use a handheld tracking shot from behind the character. Analyze how the continuous motion and slight instability inject tension and make the viewer wonder where this character is hurrying so fast—is someone following them, or do they have to get somewhere right now?

Boom & Crane
What It Is
A boom shot (or pedestal) is the simple vertical movement of the entire camera up or down, much like an elevator. A crane shot (or jib) is a more dynamic movement, using a mechanical arm to sweep the camera not just vertically, but also horizontally and diagonally, creating vast, swooping motions.

When to Use It (Narrative Intent)
These movements are about perspective, scale, and symbolic transformation:

Boom shot: It’s often used for its psychological or symbolic weight. A boom up can symbolize hope, revelation, or a character’s rising status, while a boom down can create a sense of doom, vulnerability, or finality. The boom shot can also be used to reveal new information, like a vast landscape.
Crane shot: This is a more dynamic, swooping movement. It’s a great tool for conveying grandeur and scale, often used to establish the vastness of a location, a crowd, or a battlefield. A common technique is the “god’s eye” view, where a high crane shot pulls up and away from a character, making them seem small, isolated, or overwhelmed by their environment.
Example Prompt
Starting from a first frame generated with Lucid Origin, we used this prompt with Kling 2.5 Turbo:

Prompt

The camera very slowly booms up, sweeping up and over the dark, rocky ledge before the climber does, slowly revealing the breathtaking, sun-drenched expansive perspective from the summit: a vast view of snow-capped mountains above a sea of clouds. As the camera slowly reveals this view, the climber makes her final move, pulling herself up over the ledge.

Observations
We started on purpose with a very tight shot lacking depth, with the alpinist barely holding to an uninteresting flat rock wall. The camera then slowly starts to boom up, slowly pulls out (suggesting a crane shot), and slightly tilts up (notice how different camera motions can be combined). This movement allows us to see the large landscape before the alpinist does, just as we indicated in the prompt (“sweeping up and over… before the climber does”).

Moving from that flat, uninteresting rock wall to the breathtaking landscape has a big impact on the viewer and completely shifts the energy of the shot. It feels as if that energy is transferred to the alpinist, who gets the strength for one last move to pull herself up over the ledge, joining the viewer in enjoying the view.

Exercise for You
Prompt a shot starting with a medium close-up of a man enjoying music in his car, seen through the windshield. Use a slow crane up that pulls back to reveal he is stuck in a massive, motionless traffic jam. Analyze how this crane shot is used to reveal new information that completely changes the context of the scene, shifting it from a simple shot of a driver to a clever ‘comfort-in-chaos’ ad concept.

Arc Shot
What It Is
An arc shot is when the camera “orbits” around a subject in a circular or semi-circular path, often while keeping them in the center of the frame.

When to Use It (Narrative Intent)
The arc shot is often used to create focus, tension, or iconography:

The “hero shot”: It makes a subject feel singular and important, like the center of the world. A classic example is the 360-degree shot of The Avengers assembling, which uses the arc to visually unify the team.
Realization/transformation: A slow arc can heighten a moment of realization or signify a massive character change (often combined with crossing the axis).
Focus & tension: An arc shot can be used in a standoff to increase dramatic tension. By orbiting two characters, the camera can make them feel trapped or surrounded.
Example Prompt
We first generated an image of a fashion model wearing a blue dress using our Lucid Origin model. Then, we used this prompt with Kling 2.5 Turbo:

Prompt

Full quick 360-degree bullet-time rotation around the woman. The camera performs a continuous orbit with smooth speed and strong parallax. The subject subtly rotates to face the lens during motion, maintaining focus and dramatic depth. Energetic camera choreography, crisp detail, and seamless bullet-time transition

Observations
This prompt is a good example of a product-focused shot. The narrative intent is clear: this is an ad, and its purpose is to showcase the blue dress. The 360-degree arc shot isn’t just for energy—it gives the viewer the opportunity to see the dress from all sides. 

The start frame also plays an important role. We chose a fashion model on a beach, where the yellow of the sand and the sunrise create a beautiful color harmony, complementary to the blue of the dress. The lighting on the model is also great. Altogether, Kling delivers a great shot, but most of the “trick” is done through clever prompting that controls the narrative intent.

Exercise for You
Prompt two different shots of two characters in a tense standoff in a western street. Use a very slow 180-degree arc shot that orbits both of them. Analyze how the slow, continuous movement builds dramatic tension and makes the characters feel “trapped” in the confrontation.

Final Thoughts
Kling has emerged as a powerful and accessible tool for high-end video generation, but its true potential is only unlocked when technology is guided by clear creative direction. As we’ve shown, great prompt engineering is about mastering narrative intent.

We can use the most complicated prompt frameworks available, but they will be ineffective if we don’t first understand why we’re moving the camera. The more we build with purpose—connecting every pan, push, and boom to a specific narrative goal—the better our results will be.Practice is the key to mastering, so we encourage you to go to the Leonardo.Ai app and tackle some of the exercises we suggested. We can’t wait to see the meaningful cinematic stories you bring to life!
