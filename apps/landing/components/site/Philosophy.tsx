            Anicca is built on the Buddhist path: the Five Precepts (non‑harm, honesty, non‑stealing, sexual responsibility, sobriety), generosity, and daily meditation. By nudging, preparing, and initiating at the right moments, Anicca makes these actions natural and easy—reducing suffering today while cultivating the insight that ends it. Over time, you live consistently with impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and non‑self (anatta), moving toward nirvana—the end of suffering.
