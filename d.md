# Format Instructions (EN – Theravada / Dhammapada, Short & Varied Titles)

Create a 6-slide English slideshow for Anicca.  
Theme: “Theravada Buddhist teachings” and “how they can gently ease everyday suffering.”[web:82][web:86][web:89]

## General rules

- The slideshow must have **exactly 6 slides**.  
- Keep the language simple and concrete, so a middle school student can follow it.  
- Use a calm, gentle, non‑judgmental tone.  
- You may use Pali terms (anicca, dukkha, anatta, sati, vipassana) and short Dhammapada quotes, but always explain them briefly in plain English.[web:82][web:83][web:88]  

---

## Slide 1 (hook slide)

- Use **only 1 text item**.  
- Keep the title short (phone‑screen friendly).  
- Do **not** use questions as titles.  
- Write titles in the style of these examples (you can reuse or slightly adapt them):  
  - “A small way to sit with pain”  
  - “Soften today’s self‑hatred a little”  
  - “A gentler way to hold your anger”  
  - “For nights when you can’t sleep”  
  - “When you’re tired of comparing yourself”  
  - “For days when nothing feels enough”  

The title should point to a concrete situation or emotion, not to abstract doctrine.

## Slides 2–5 (teaching or quote + explanation)

Each of slides 2–5 uses **2 text items**.

### Text item 1 (numbered title)

- Format: number + concept name, or number + very short quote.  
- Examples:  
  - “1. Anicca – everything changes”  
  - “2. Dukkha – when life won’t obey us”  
  - “3. Anatta – you are more than this story”  
  - “4. Sati – gentle awareness”  
  - “1. ‘All conditioned things are impermanent’”  
  - “2. ‘Mind is chief’”  

- Rotate between themes like:  
  - anicca (impermanence)  
  - dukkha (unsatisfactoriness, suffering)  
  - anatta (not‑self)  
  - sati (mindful awareness)  
  - basic vipassana ideas (observe, don’t fight)[web:87][web:90]  
  - short Dhammapada lines about mind, craving, anger, peace[web:82][web:88]  

### Text item 2 (short, concrete explanation)

- Explain how this teaching meets **one** everyday kind of suffering.  
- One idea per line, short and direct. Examples:  
  - “This feeling will not stay exactly the same.”  
  - “You are not wrong for hurting; you are human.”  
  - “You can watch this thought without obeying it.”  
  - “A few mindful breaths can soften your chest a little.”  
  - “Not everything is your fault; causes are many.”  

- Do **not** offer multiple options in one line.  
  One clear idea or invitation only.

## Slide 6 (closing message)

Slide 6 also has **2 text items**.

### Text item 1 (closing title)

- Short, kind, and **not** a question.  
- Examples:  
  - “Noticing is already enough for today”  
  - “You don’t have to fix everything now”  
  - “Please be gentle with the one who is suffering”  
  - “Even this small step matters”  

### Text item 2 (gentle encouragement)

- One short line that reassures and normalizes suffering.  
- Examples:  
  - “You are not alone; many hearts have walked this same road.”  
  - “Seeing your pain clearly is already the start of release.”  
  - “Even if you still feel heavy, something in you has understood.”  
  - “You can always return to one breath, one moment of noticing.”  

---

## Nuance

- Focus on **real situations** (self‑hatred, comparing, sleepless nights, anxiety) and let the Buddhist teaching sit beside them.  
- The tone is never “you should”, always “you can, if you like”.  
- The overall feeling should be: this is a short, honest companion for a hard day, not a lecture.
