- Describe what your company does in 50 characters or less.
  "Proactive voice AI that leads your life"
- Explain your decision regarding location.
  "Because San Francisco has the highest concentration of builders who truly believe AGI is imminent, and I need to build alongside them."
- What is your company going to make?
  "We’re building a proactive voice agent that wakes you, walks you through every routine, and pulls you forward like Apollo in Rocky until each commitment is done. It reads your calendar, Slack, and desktop context, intervenes before you drift, and keeps leading you to your best self without relying on willpower. Ultimately it will tackle the hardest addictions and entrenched habits, guiding even the most reluctant person into lasting discipline."
- Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you’re making?
  "I’ve spent the past five years obsessed with behavior change, now study it in grad school, and treat every human problem as a behavior problem. Whether it’s oversleeping, addiction, or failing to meditate—every pain exists because we can’t act the way we intend, and nothing else changes until our actions do. I’m my own heaviest user, pay for Anicca, and see it working. People need this because they’re desperate for something that finally makes them behave the way they intend."
- Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don’t?
  "No one is building a proactive behavior-change agent. Habit apps, calendars, and assistants like ChatGPT or Alexa stay reactive; they wait to be prompted and treat behavior change as a side effect. I’m building the opposite: an agent designed only to change what you do, willing to intervene unprompted, and willing to shoulder the responsibility that big companies avoid. The agent must lead rather than merely support, and I’ll say that plainly even when others shy away from admitting AI already steers behavior. That conviction to design a leader—not a helper—is my moat."
- If you applied before, did anything change? Why did you pivot and what did you learn?
  "I previously applied with a real-time auditory feedback tool to keep people mindful. The problem never changed—it was always about behavior—but I learned that the solution has to be a proactive agent that knows you and leads you. I also learned to build what I personally pay for and to focus on hard behavior outcomes instead of subjective mindfulness metrics."
- How many active users or customers do you have? How many are paying? Who is paying the most, and how much?
  "Right now I’m the only active and paying user. I charge myself $5 per month to prove it’s worth paying for, and it already wakes me every morning."
- もし他回答が必要な設問（例：incubator未参加）
  "I’ve never participated in nor committed to any incubator, accelerator, or pre-accelerator program."
